## FAQ

**Why does this exist?**

Solving challenging problems is the best way to improve programming skills. Building a game is usually not part of the daily business of a system engineer. I wanted to know if it is possible to build such a game using the PowerShell scripting language, which I love and admire so much.

**Do you intend to add new features?**

No, not really. Despite I've got lot of ideas on my mind (leaderboard, settings store, level with walls, bot playing the game) it is too time consuming.
